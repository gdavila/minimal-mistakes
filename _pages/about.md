This is my personal tech blog!

I'm a Tech Architect with experience in video streaming, cloud architectures, virtualized frameworks (kubernetes, docker) and with great interest in software development.

Throughout my career I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of technologies and services. Currently, I'm focused on cutting edge technologies for the video Industry and additionally I'm a passionate open source project contributor in my free time.

Finally, I have experience in academic research on the Data Communications and Internet Topology field by collaborating (2013-2017) to [CoNexDat](https://cnet.fi.uba.ar/) Research Group at Buenos Aires University, where I got my MS in Telecommunications Engineering.

In this way and I feel comfortable with new technical challenges that requires out of the box thinking, strong  data analysis tools (R, SQL, mongoDB) and solid knowledge of  programming languages (C++, Python, javascript).
